## The Challenge

Known throughout the East Tennessee region for their decades of providing quality mental health and social services to under-serviced communities, The McNabb Center was unfortunately saddled with a website that lacked the features and professionalism of an organization that serves nearly 60,000 people each year. For their updated website, they expressed the need to bring a more professional feel to their organization, while ensuring that their service information was clearly organized and easily accessible.

## Discovered Opportunities

After conducting a thorough audit of the existing site, three primary opportunities to help make the site better meet the clientâ€™s business needs were highlighted:

1. **Creating a design language that distinguishes service areas**: With four overarching categories of care, distinguishing each focus area and its various subcategories using both colors and iconography would help to give the site a clear and intuitive organizational logic.
2. **Developing a more robust search experience**: With so many different services offered across multiple categories, having an easily accessible and intuitive search feature that could be utilized from anywhere on the site was a necessity.
3. **Making the crisis hotlines easier to access**: The organization's crisis hotlines are a crucial resource for those in desperate and immediate need of assistance. Making these hotlines easy to reach and utilize was one of the focal points of the design stage.

## Creating A Design Language That Distinguishes Service Areas

During our design discovery phase, we determined a major focal point was how the organization delineates between their different service areas. For context, the Center offers services that fall under the umbrella of one of four categories: Mental Health, Substance Use Treatment, Social Services, and Victim Services. Prior to our involvement, the Center had already made a habit of distinguishing their services with unique colors, we simply tweaked their original color schemes to better complement their iconic brand colors, while also introducing iconography to accomodate users with color blindness.
