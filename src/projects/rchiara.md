## The Challenge

As a boutique fine jewelry brand based in the heart of NYC’s famous diamond district, r. chiara needed a refreshed website that better showcased their uniquely handcrafted pieces while also providing an agile backend framework to facilitate quick and seamless promotional changeovers throughout the year.

## Discovered Opportunities

After conducting a thorough audit of the existing site, three primary opportunities to help make the site better meet the client's business needs were highlighted:

1. **Crafting a cohesive design language**: The site's design was fragmented, with no consistent visual or thematic elements to tie the brand together. This lack of coherence left the brand feeling unclear and disconnected.
2. **Elevating the shopping experience**: The user experience of the site lacked a clear understanding of the product and the intricacies of shopping for jewelry online — a poor search experience, the lack of controls to filter products and a simplistic product detail page culminated in a frustrating shopping experience.
3. **Supercharging the CMS**: The theme was overly rigid in its customization capabilities — limited settings for each module in the backend meant that updating the site to align with promotional or seasonal changeovers was often too time-consuming or altogether impossible.

## Crafting a Cohesive Design Language

The original site was missing a distinct design language and brand voice, which left it feeling unfinished and devoid of character. As a part of the redesign, the client sought to establish a design style that would convey the quality and uniqueness of their pieces while still allowing the beauty of their jewelry to take center stage.

We started by gathering inspiration from a variety of sources, including the client's reference sites, to assemble a moodboard from which we could derive a distinct design direction.

The end result was a design system that echoed the quality and elegance of the brand, featuring a clean and sophisticated serif font for headings, and accented by various shades of the boutique's signature pink, plum and powder colors.

With the help of the new design system, we composed a suite of visually consistent modules the client could use out-of-the-box throughout the site in a variety of combinations.  This gave nearly limitless possibilities for various promotions or releases throughout the season.

## Elevating the Shopping Experience

One of the major shortcomings of the original site was its search experience. Finding a jewelry piece required too many steps and lacked modern eCommerce features like search suggestions and predictive results. In designing the updated search experience, our goal was to provide shoppers with various pathways to discover the perfect piece—whether they're searching for a specific ring, exploring a collection for inspiration, or looking to inquire about custom bridal pieces.

Product filtering and sorting on the previous site were notably limited, providing just a handful of options. Our redesigned experience gave shoppers more control, enabling them to easily filter products by price range and metal type, ensuring they could find exactly what they were looking for.

A key highlight of our redesign was the transformation of the product detail page, where we aimed to enhance the way shoppers interact with and appreciate the jewelry. The client desired the capability to include high-resolution videos to showcase their jewelry, along with the option to zoom in on images. Our solution was a comprehensive media gallery that allowed shoppers to explore each piece in stunning detail.
