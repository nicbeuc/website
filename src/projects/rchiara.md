## Challenge

As a growing boutique jewelry brand based in NYC’s competitive diamond district, r.chiara needed a refreshed website that better showcased their uniquely handcrafted pieces, while also providing an agile backend framework for quick and seamless promotional changeovers throughout the year.

## Opportunities

After conducting a thorough audit of the existing site, three primary opportunities to help better meet the client's business needs were highlighted:

1. **Elevating the shopping experience**: The user experience of the site lacked a clear understanding of the product and the intricacies of shopping for jewelry online — a poor search experience, the lack of controls to filter products and subpar responsiveness culminated in a frustrating shopping experience.
2. **Capturing new leads**: The site lacked a dedicated funnel to promote their jewelry resetting services — a vital part of their business.
3. **Supercharging the CMS**: The theme was overly rigid in its customization capabilities — limited settings for each module in the backend meant that updating the site to align with promotional or seasonal changeovers was often too time-consuming or altogether impossible.

## Elevating the Shopping Experience

One of the weakest aspects of the existing site was the search experience. Trying to search for a jewelry piece was a multi-step process that lacked modern ecommerce search features, such as search suggestions and predictive search. When building the updated search experience, our goal was to give the shopper a variety of pathways to find the perfect piece; whether they are looking for a specific ring, a collection for inspiration, or a page to learn more about the business.

Similarly, product filtering and sorting on the existing site was severely limited; shoppers were only given the option to sort products based on a handful of parameters. Our revamped experience put the power back in the shopper's hands, which most importantly allowed them to find pieces within a specific price range and ones that featured a certain metal type.
